This is a **lightweight**, **auto-generated** and **thin** Swift wrapper around the popular and excellent [**dear imgui**](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) library.  
It provides a **swifty** and -especially - **typesafe** API. It is easily maintainable and updatable, as well, since it relies heavily on automated code generation.

There are working [demo examples](Sources/Demos/), too, provided as part of the library.

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine and provide a code example.

### üìã Prerequisites

* [Swift Package Manager (SPM)](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)
* [Swiftlint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) for linting - (optional)
* [SwiftEnv](https://swiftenv.fuller.li/) for Swift version management - (optional)

### üíª Installing

Swift ImGui is available for all platforms that support [Swift 5.3](https://swift.org/) and higher and the [Swift Package Manager (SPM)](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager).

Extend the following lines in your `Package.swift` file or use it to create a new project.

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.3

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YourPackageName",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/ctreffs/SwiftImGui.git", from: "1.78.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "YourTargetName",
            dependencies: ["ImGui"])
    ]
)

```


## üìù Code Example

A minimal example is located at [Sources/Demos/Minimal/main.swift](Sources/Demos/Minimal/main.swift).   
This is an excerpt:

```swift
import ImGui

IMGUI_CHECKVERSION()
let ctx = ImGuiCreateContext(nil)
let io = ImGuiGetIO()!

/// Build font atlas
var pixels: UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8>?
var width: Int32 = 0
var height: Int32 = 0
var bytesPerPixel: Int32 = 0
ImFontAtlas_GetTexDataAsRGBA32(io.pointee.Fonts, &pixels, &width, &height, &bytesPerPixel)

for n in 0..<20 {
    io.pointee.DisplaySize = ImVec2(x: 1920, y: 1080)
    io.pointee.DeltaTime = 1.0 / 60.0
    ImGuiNewFrame()
    var f: Float = 0.0
    ImGuiTextV("Hello, world!")
    ImGuiSliderFloat("float", &f, 0.0, 1.0, nil, 1)
    ImGuiTextV("Application average %.3f ms/frame (%.1f FPS)", 1000.0 / io.pointee.Framerate, io.pointee.Framerate)
    ImGuiShowDemoWindow(nil)
    ImGuiRender()
}

ImGuiDestroyContext(ctx)
```

## üÜï Update SwiftImGui

SwiftImGui uses a mutli-stage process to update to the latest imgui version. See [HOWTO.md](docs/HOWTO.md) for details.

## üíÅ Help needed

This project needs a lot of love.
If you are interested in contributing please feel free to do so!

Things that need to be done among others are:

- [ ] Extend the AutoWrapper to wrap more cimgui functions (currently there are 81 'invalid' functions that will not be wrapped. 799 will be wrapped properly.)
- [ ] Some vector functions are not available via the c interface - see `Sources/AutoWrapper/Exceptions.swift`
- [ ] Find a solution for manual adjustments in cimgui generator template
- [ ] Write some more tests

## üè∑Ô∏è Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [releases on this repository](https://github.com/ctreffs/SwiftImGui/releases).

## üôè Original code

Since SwiftImGui is merely a wrapper around [**imgui**](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) it obviously depends on it.    
It also makes use of the excellent c-api wrapper [**cimgui**](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui).   
Support them if you can!

----

Dear ImGui is a **bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++**. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and self-contained (no external dependencies).

Dear ImGui is designed to **enable fast iterations** and to **empower programmers** to create **content creation tools and visualization / debug tools** (as opposed to UI for the average end-user). It favors simplicity and productivity toward this goal, and lacks certain features normally found in more high-level libraries.

Dear ImGui is particularly suited to integration in games engine (for tooling), real-time 3D applications, fullscreen applications, embedded applications, or any applications on consoles platforms where operating system features are non-standard.


### cimgui

##### From [cimgui/cimgui/README.md](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui/blob/master/README.md)

CImGui is a thin c-api wrapper programmatically generated for the excellent C++ immediate mode gui Dear ImGui. All imgui.h functions are programmatically wrapped. Generated files are: cimgui.cpp, cimgui.h for C compilation. Also for helping in bindings creation, definitions.lua with function definition information and structs_and_enums.lua. This library is intended as a intermediate layer to be able to use Dear ImGui from other languages that can interface with C (like D - see D-binding)
